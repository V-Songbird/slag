# Public docs: READMEs and CHANGELOGs

These files are read by end users of the plugins. Every line must help a user decide or act — nothing else earns a place.

- Describe what the plugin does and what a release changes **for the user**. Never document internal process: no benchmark methodology, run tags, sample sizes, per-rep numbers, A/B setups, transcript quotes, or investigation narratives. That detail lives in private memory only.
- CHANGELOG entries are short and user-facing — "Fixed an issue where…", "Added…" — a few lines at most. State the effect, not the journey. No design rationale, no lessons learned, no wording-choice commentary.
- READMEs describe **current** behavior only. Never narrate history ("used to X, now closed") and never keep a caveat for an issue that is already resolved — the CHANGELOG is the record of the past.
- A known limitation belongs in the README only while it is real, current, and user-relevant. When it's fixed, delete the caveat entirely; don't soften it to "mostly closed".
- Never name another project anywhere in a public record — not competitors, not tools or repos used as references, inspiration, or benchmarks. This covers READMEs, CHANGELOGs, manifests, code comments, test names and fixtures, branch names, PR text, and **git commit messages** (subject and body) across the root repo and every submodule. Contrast with generic categories ("a rival tool", "a public reference") and sell on own merits. The names themselves live only in gitignored private notes (`docs/research/`); a pre-commit + commit-msg hook (`scripts/git-hooks/check-reference-names.js`, blocklist gitignored, fail-open when absent) enforces this mechanically.
- Match the canonical skeleton/voice in `.github/PLUGIN_README_TEMPLATE.md` — dry, deadpan, personality-forward (not warm-corporate hype); the template carries a synthetic voice exemplar to calibrate against. Two non-negotiables: never name another project, and no profanity.
- Every plugin here is an experiment with no support promise. A plugin README states that plainly once, near the top, and then gets on with describing the plugin — it does not apologize for itself in every section.
- For a callout that needs visual weight (an honest limitation, a non-destructive guarantee, a cost caveat), use GitHub's alert syntax — `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]` — instead of an italic aside. Pick the type by actual stakes: NOTE/TIP for helpful context, IMPORTANT for something the user needs to succeed, WARNING/CAUTION for real risk. Don't reach for WARNING or CAUTION to manufacture urgency a NOTE would cover. Use one or two per file, not one per paragraph.
