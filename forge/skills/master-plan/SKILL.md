description: Consolidates the expert reports from `/forge:expert-analysis` into a single master implementation plan that the user can audit at a glance. Walks every expert report; reconciles overlapping claims; resolves cross-domain conflicts by reading the code; produces a single-layer plan (Feature, Steps, Risks, Open questions) capped at ≤ 80 lines for typical features. Optional Integration-contract appendix only when the plan has ≥ 2 steps marked `Parallel-friendly: yes`. Produces the plan in conversation context only — no file is written.
when_to_use: Use as Step 4 of the forge workflow, immediately after `/forge:expert-analysis` returns.

# Master Plan Synthesis

Synthesize the expert reports into a single, code-grounded plan the user can audit in one sitting. Runs in the main session (no subagent dispatch); the orchestrator does the consolidation directly because the expert reports already live in conversation context.

> **This skill is the in-session fallback path (Step 4) for when the `Workflow` tool is absent.** In a normal full/deep run, synthesis is the `forge-plan-synthesizer` agent, dispatched inside the Forge Workflow pipeline (`skills/forge/references/workflow-pipeline.md`) — same procedure and constraints, but it receives the expert reports as structured input rather than reading them from conversation. The orchestrator invokes this skill only when `Workflow` is unavailable or the pipeline returned `{ error }`.

## Required Inputs

- Every expert report from the most recent `/forge:expert-analysis` run, present in the conversation transcript. On the standard path these are markdown reports parsed by heading; on the deep-mode path they are structured JSON objects from the Workflow result — the fields map one-to-one onto the report headings, and the synthesis procedure below is identical for both.
- The original feature requirements as the user expressed them.
- Optional: any user clarifications since the experts were dispatched.

## What to produce

A single markdown plan inside the conversation, capped at **≤ 80 lines for typical features** (1–3 steps; ≤ 120 lines for 4–5 steps). The plan has four sections, in this order: **Feature**, **Steps**, **Risks**, **Open questions**. An optional **Integration contract** appendix is appended ONLY when the plan has ≥ 2 steps marked `Parallel-friendly: yes`.

For the full template with field-by-field guidance, see [references/plan-structure.md](references/plan-structure.md).

**This plan is the critic's input, not a user-facing message.** Draft it in conversation context as the verbatim body of the `/forge:critic-review` dispatch; do NOT render it as a standalone block for the user (see the forge skill's *Show the plan once*). The user sees only a status line at this step and reads the full plan once — final form, at Step 7, via `/forge:plan-revise`.

## Synthesis procedure

1. **Scan `## Findings summary` sections first.** Every expert report opens with a tagged summary. Collect all `conflict:` lines — each one names two locations that need reconciliation and becomes a synthesis task before step descriptions are written. Collect all `touch:` lines to seed the `Files touched` sets. Collect all `assumption:` lines to flag for the critic. Only after this pass, read the prose sections for depth. This order prevents synthesizing a plan on top of an unresolved conflict the experts already flagged.

2. **Cluster the steps.** Each step is a bounded edit a reader can hold in their head. 1 step is fine for focused changes; 5 is the practical ceiling. Cluster by what belongs together, NOT by parallelism — disjointness is the `Parallel-friendly` annotation's job, not the step boundary's.
3. **Write step descriptions as prose.** 2–4 sentences naming what gets built, against which existing patterns (cite `file:line`), and the order if it matters. NO numbered substeps, NO inline pseudocode, NO code snippets.
4. **Reconcile citations.** Every `file:line` cited by any expert appears in exactly one step's "Files touched" list. If two experts cite the same line with conflicting interpretations, MUST invoke `Read` on the file and resolve by reading the code yourself.
5. **Triage risks ruthlessly.** A risk has the shape: "if this mitigation goes wrong, the user observes <symptom>." Cap at 3. One-line code fixes (clamps, sort tie-breaks, exclusion sets) are NOT risks — fold them into the relevant step's description as a sentence and drop the row.
6. **Triage open questions ruthlessly.** Only items the user must decide. If you have a recommendation, write it as a stated decision in the relevant step's description and drop the row. Empty `Open questions` section is fine and common.
7. **Annotate `Parallel-friendly: yes` only when honest.** A step gets the annotation ONLY if its "Files touched" set is genuinely disjoint from every other step's AND its description has no ordering dependency. Default: omit the line entirely.
8. **Emit the Integration-contract appendix only when ≥ 2 steps are `Parallel-friendly: yes`.** Otherwise omit the appendix entirely; contract details fold inline into the relevant step's description (e.g. "subscribe to the dispatcher at `Foo.cs:120`, signature `void Handle(Bar)`"). For in-session implementation, the inline form is sufficient.

## Critical Constraints

- **Hard size cap: ≤ 80 lines for typical 1–3 step features; ≤ 120 lines for 4–5 step features.** If you exceed this, you've leaked implementation work into the plan. Cut prose, drop one-line-mitigation risks, fold Open questions with recommendations into stated decisions.
- **NEVER write the plan to disk.** Per workflow design, the plan lives in conversation context until `/forge:plan-revise` finishes.
- **NEVER render the plan as a user-facing block at this step.** It is the critic's verbatim input; the user reads it once, at Step 7. Showing it here creates the double-plan read that *Show the plan once* exists to prevent.
- **NEVER preserve a Risk row whose mitigation is a one-line code edit.** Those are implementation details. The Risks section is for failure modes the implementer or critic could realistically miss.
- **NEVER preserve an Open question with a recommendation attached.** If you have an answer, write the answer into the relevant step's description and drop the question.
- **NEVER write step descriptions as pseudocode.** If your description has numbered substeps, code snippets, or branching logic, you're writing the implementation in the plan. Cut to prose.
- **NEVER emit the Integration-contract appendix for a single-step or sequential plan.** It is not load-bearing in those cases and just bloats the audit surface.
- **Cite `file:line` on every claim.** Plans without citations fail the critic and the implementer cannot verify against the code.

## Gate metric (internal)

Compute these counts from the `## Findings summary` scan and carry them forward to the Step 7 digest. They are an internal continuity signal, NOT a user-facing footer (see the forge skill's *Communication* contract) — do NOT emit a `coverage:` line to the user.

- domains = number of expert reports
- conflicts = `conflict:` lines reconciled
- assumptions = `assumption:` lines carried into the plan as critic targets

Their substance reaches the user once, in plain language, inside the Step 7 digest ("synthesized from 3 expert reviews; 3 cross-domain conflicts resolved").

## Next Step

After drafting the plan, emit one status line to the user — **"Plan drafted — \<N\> steps; sending it to the critic."** — and invoke `/forge:critic-review`, passing the plan verbatim. Do NOT render the plan as a user-facing block here: per the forge skill's *Show the plan once*, the plan is the critic's input now and reaches the user once, in final form, at the Step 7 gate via `/forge:plan-revise`.
