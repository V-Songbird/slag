description: Parallel implementation dispatcher for forge plans. Dispatches one `forge-implementer` subagent per parallel-friendly step, each in an isolated git worktree, so they can write code in parallel without stepping on each other. Each implementer receives only its assigned step (the "work unit") + the integration contract; the implementer constraints are baked into the `forge-implementer` agent's system prompt. MUST invoke `TaskCreate` for each work unit (paired `content` + `activeForm`) before the parallel `Agent` calls. Returns per-unit completion reports for aggregation by `/forge:build-and-report`.
when_to_use: Load at Step 8 of the forge workflow when the approved revised master plan contains ≥ 2 steps marked `Parallel-friendly: yes`. For plans with fewer than 2 such steps, implement directly in the main session — coordination overhead beats wall-time savings.

# Dispatch Implementation

Step 8 helper for plans with ≥ 2 steps marked `Parallel-friendly: yes`. Dispatches one `forge-implementer` subagent per qualifying step, each in `isolation: "worktree"`. Once a step is assigned to a parallel implementer, this skill (and the `forge-implementer` subagent) refers to it as the implementer's "work unit". Worktree isolation is the safety net: implementers cannot see or stomp on each other's edits, the orchestrator gets per-unit branches/diffs, and the user's main worktree stays clean until merge.

If the plan has fewer than 2 parallel-friendly steps, do NOT use this skill. Implement in the main session — the parallelism does not pay for itself once you account for orchestrator-side dispatch + merge overhead. The forge skill's "After approval" section spells out the routing.

## Required Inputs

- The approved revised master plan in conversation context (from `/forge:plan-revise`, with user approval at Step 7).
- The list of `Parallel-friendly: yes` steps from the plan. If invoked with `all` (default), dispatch every qualifying step in parallel; if invoked with a specific W-ID (e.g. `2` for W2), dispatch only that one (used for re-runs of a failed step).

## Pre-dispatch — TaskCreate per work unit

Before the parallel `Agent` calls, MUST invoke `TaskCreate` once per work unit being dispatched. Pair `content` + `activeForm` per the workflow standard:

```
TaskCreate(
  content: "Implement step W<N>: <step title>",
  activeForm: "Implementing step W<N>: <step title>"
)
```

The task list is what the user reads while the parallel implementers run. One row per work unit, in W-ID order.

After all `TaskCreate` calls land, mark every work-unit task `in_progress` via `TaskUpdate` in a single tool-use block, then fire all `Agent` calls in the next single tool-use block. Do NOT interleave per-unit `TaskUpdate` calls with `Agent` calls — every task must be `in_progress` before any implementer dispatches.

## Dispatch Template

For each qualifying step being dispatched, MUST invoke `Agent` in a single tool-use block (parallel execution):

```
Agent(
  description: "Implement step W<N>: <step title>",
  subagent_type: "forge-implementer",
  model: "sonnet",         # mirrors forge-implementer.md frontmatter; explicit so the dispatch is self-documenting
  run_in_background: false,
  isolation: "worktree",
  prompt: """
## Your work unit (plan step W<N>)
<full step block from the plan: title, files touched, description (with inline contract-clause references like "fulfills C1, C3"), done-when criterion, Parallel-friendly: yes annotation>

## Integration contract (your unit fulfills only the clauses cited in your description, but you MUST not violate other clauses)
<full integration contract appendix from the plan — appears only when ≥ 2 disjoint steps exist, which is the precondition for this skill running>
"""
)
```

The `forge-implementer` agent's system prompt (in `forge/agents/forge-implementer.md`) carries the full constraints — files-touched discipline, contract honoring, citation discipline, blocker escalation, single-commit rule, return format. The dispatch prompt only inlines the per-step content.

The turn budget is set exclusively by the agent's `maxTurns:` frontmatter (currently `60`). The `Agent` tool does NOT accept `max_turns` or `name` at the call site — both are silently dropped by the harness — so do not pass them here. To change the per-implementer budget, edit the agent's frontmatter.

Keep the agent ID from each dispatch result. Blocker resolution resumes implementers by ID via `SendMessage` (see "Handling implementer reports").

## Critical Constraints

- **`isolation: "worktree"` on every dispatch.** Without it, parallel implementers race on the same files. The worktree gives each its own filesystem view + branch.
- **`subagent_type: "forge-implementer"` on every dispatch.**
- **All dispatches in one tool-use block.** Sequential dispatch defeats the parallelism the worktree isolation enables.
- **`TaskCreate` before `Agent`.** The user reads the task list while implementers run; one row per work unit.
- **NEVER instruct implementers to call `AskUserQuestion`.** Subagents cannot reliably use it (background mode fails silently). Implementers escalate blockers in their report; the orchestrator handles user interaction.
- **NEVER tell implementers to merge their worktrees.** The orchestrator merges after aggregation, in `/forge:build-and-report`.

## Handling implementer reports

When implementers return:

- **Hard blockers (non-empty Blockers section)** — STOP. The orchestrator decides between resume-with-decision, revise-plan-and-redispatch, reassign-unit, or accept-with-evidence. Do not proceed to merge with an unresolved hard blocker. MUST invoke `TaskUpdate` to keep the task `in_progress` (with an updated `activeForm` describing the blocker) until resolved.
  - **Resume-first.** When the blocker needs only a ruling the orchestrator (or the user at the approval gate) can give — a contract-clause interpretation, a plan-vs-reality drift the plan author can rule on, an expanded "Files touched" set — and the work unit itself is unchanged, MUST invoke `SendMessage` to that implementer's agent ID with the decision. The implementer resumes in its existing worktree with its read context intact, which is far cheaper than a fresh dispatch that re-reads everything.
  - **Fresh dispatch only when the work unit changes.** If resolving the blocker re-slices the plan (new step boundaries, reassigned files), revise the plan first and re-dispatch that unit fresh — stale context misleads once the assignment itself has changed.
  - If `SendMessage` is unavailable in this session (older Claude Code builds), fall back to revise-plan-and-redispatch.
- **Done-when criterion: no / partial-because** — same treatment as a hard blocker.
- **All units returned clean** — MUST invoke `TaskUpdate` to mark each work-unit task `completed`. Then proceed to `/forge:build-and-report`.

## Next Step

After all implementers return clean, invoke `/forge:build-and-report` to merge worktrees, run the project's build, and emit the final report.
