# Forge Workflow pipeline — Steps 2–6 in one Workflow call

This is the default analysis path for `/forge` and `/forge deep`. One `Workflow` invocation runs the structural search, the reality-check spike, the parallel experts, plan synthesis, the adversarial critique, and the revision — Steps 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the pipeline. The main session keeps Steps 1 and 2.3 (which need the `Skill` tool, unavailable inside a Workflow) before the call, and Steps 7–10 (approval, implementation, build) after it.

When the `Workflow` tool is absent (Claude Code < 2.1.154), fall back to the sequential path: `/forge:expert-analysis` → `/forge:master-plan` → `/forge:critic-review` → `/forge:plan-revise`, each in the main session. The Workflow path and the fallback produce the same artifact — a revised master plan — so Step 7 onward is identical either way.

## Why one Workflow instead of four skill calls

- **Schema-validated handoffs.** Expert reports, the critique, and the revised plan are validated against JSON schemas at the tool layer, with automatic retry on malformed output. No heading-parsing between steps.
- **Native progress.** `phase()` drives the status register — one phase box per pipeline stage — so the main session emits nothing between the kickoff line and the Step 7 gate.
- **The approval gate stays in the main session.** A Workflow cannot call `AskUserQuestion`. Splitting analysis (Workflow) from approval (main session) is what makes the human gate work — see the spike early-exit below for the other place control returns to the main session.

## Invocation

The pipeline ships as a file: `forge/workflows/forge-pipeline.workflow.mjs`. Invoke it by `scriptPath` — no re-emitting the script.

This reference file lives at `<plugin>/skills/forge/references/workflow-pipeline.md`, so the script is `../../../workflows/forge-pipeline.workflow.mjs` from here. Resolve that to an absolute path from this file's own location (you know it — you just read this file), then invoke:

```
Workflow(
  scriptPath: "<absolute path to workflows/forge-pipeline.workflow.mjs>",
  args: {
    "feature": "<verbatim feature requirements from the user>",
    "domainAuthority": [
      { "skill": "<skill name invoked in Step 2.3>", "output": "<that skill's full output>" }
    ],
    "deep": <true for `/forge deep`, false for `/forge`>
  }
)
```

- `domainAuthority` is `[]` when Step 2.3 found no authoritative project skill.
- `deep` toggles the refuter panel in the Critique phase. Everything else is identical between full and deep.
- Pass `args` as a real JSON object, not a stringified one — the script reads `args.feature`, `args.domainAuthority`, `args.deep`.

**Precedence when invoking:**

1. **`scriptPath`** — the shipped file, resolved as above. This is the default.
2. **Inline `script`** — only if the file read fails, invoke `Workflow` with the verbatim script under [Fallback script](#fallback-script) below (`script: <that block>`) and the same `args`.
3. **Sequential skills** — only if the `Workflow` tool is absent (Claude Code < 2.1.154): `/forge:expert-analysis` → `/forge:master-plan` → `/forge:critic-review` → `/forge:plan-revise`. Same artifact, so Step 7 onward is unchanged.

## After the Workflow returns

The result arrives as a task notification. WAIT for it before doing anything in the main session, then branch on the return value:

- **`spikeRefuted: true`** — the scout's reality-check spike refuted the riskiest assumption. The Workflow halted before dispatching experts. Surface `assumption` + `spikeEvidence` to the user as a Decision-register finding (the forge skill's *Communication* contract) and ask for a corrected scope. Do NOT silently re-scope. This is the spike's STOP rung, relocated from the main session into the Workflow.
- **`spikeRefuted: false`** — `plan` is the revised master plan markdown (resolution table included). Carry `gate` into the Step 7 digest as plain-language lines, present the digest + plan, and invoke `AskUserQuestion`. This is *Show the plan once* — the plan reaches the user here, in final form, for the first and only time.
- **`error` (script-caught), or a `status: failed` task notification with no `result` field at all (an uncaught, platform-level failure)** — a stage returned nothing after retries, the script threw and the top-level catch converted it to `{ error, phase }`, or the throw itself escaped the catch and reached the notification layer raw. Both shapes are recoverable the same way — **resume first, sequential fallback second**, never a bare re-run:
  1. **Capture `runId`** from the *original* Workflow tool result — it's returned immediately on every invocation, regardless of how the run eventually ends.
  2. **If that run still shows live**, `TaskStop` it before doing anything else.
  3. **Re-invoke `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: runId, args})`.** The longest unchanged prefix of `agent()` calls (matched on prompt + opts) replays from cache instantly; only the failed stage and everything after it re-runs live. This is **same-session only** — if the session was restarted since the original run, skip straight to step 4. A script-caught error's `phase` field, or the failed notification's own `<recovery>` block, both point at the same resume call.
  4. **If the resumed run also errors** (or resume isn't available because the session restarted), fall back to the sequential skill path for the remaining steps.
  5. **Before treating a *completed* run's result as wrong or suspiciously empty**, read `<transcriptDir>/journal.jsonl` — it records each agent's actual return value, and a cache-replayed stage can legitimately look empty; don't diagnose from a hunch when the journal has the answer.

## Fallback script

This is the exact content of `forge/workflows/forge-pipeline.workflow.mjs`, kept here as the human-readable source and the inline-`script` fallback (precedence step 2 above). Use it only when the file read fails; otherwise invoke by `scriptPath`.

Search the codebase (Read/Grep/Glob) for the essential structural knowledge the feature touches. Identify 3–5 anchor files an expert should start from — each with a one-phrase reason. Summarize what the feature touches in ≤10 bullet-equivalents.

## 2. Expert selection (Step 3 input)
Choose which domain experts to dispatch, driven by what the search surfaced. Cap at 5. Ask three questions:
- Architectural shape? Cross-cutting (touches many layers) → architecture mandatory; localized → optional.
- Primary risk axis? UI responsiveness / large data → performance. Auth / data exposure / external input → security. Persistence / migration → data-state. Visual or interaction-heavy → ui-ux.
- Validation surface? Behavior-changing → testing is worthwhile; pure refactor → skip testing.
Merge near-duplicates (>50% overlap → one combined expert). If the feature text names specific domains, honor exactly that list. A single-expert dispatch is occasionally right. Return the chosen domains.

## 3. Reality-check spike (Step 2.5)
Identify the single riskiest assumption — the claim that, if false, invalidates the whole design — and run a ≤30-line read to confirm or refute it. Return verdict=confirmed (assumption holds, pipeline proceeds), verdict=refuted (assumption is false — the pipeline will HALT and ask the user to re-scope), or verdict=none (the feature has no risky assumption: pure refactor, well-trodden CRUD). Ground confirmed/refuted in file:line evidence.

## Design notes

- **The barrier in the Experts phase is correct, not a smell.** Synthesis needs every report before it starts; there is no per-report downstream stage to pipeline into.
- **The spike early-exit is the one place control returns to the main session mid-pipeline.** A Workflow cannot call `AskUserQuestion`, so a refuted spike returns a flag and the main session handles the user redirect — the same reason the approval gate (Step 7) lives outside the Workflow.
- **`deep` adds only the Verify phase.** The refuter panel marks each Blocking finding `panel_refuted` when both lens-distinct refuters ground a refutation; the reviser verifies those first. Full runs skip the phase entirely.
- **Every stage fails soft.** A `null` from any `agent()` (user skip, terminal API error after retries) returns `{ error }` rather than throwing where avoidable — the main session resumes via `resumeFromRunId` first, and only falls back to the sequential skill path if resume also fails (see *After the Workflow returns*).
